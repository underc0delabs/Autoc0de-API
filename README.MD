# Autoc0de - API

![Logo](img/autoc0de-api.png)

## _Open source tests automation framework for API with BDD and TDD_

# Indice

In this README.MD we will see the following topics:

- What can we do with this Framework
- What technologies are incorporated (Technological Stak)
- Project architecture
- Tools needed to run it locally and Steps to run the Framework
- How to change the suite to be run
- How to see a great Report
- How to configure Autoc0de for your API testing

## What can we do with this Framework

- Add automated test cases for test your API's
- Use a powerful technologist called Rest Assured
- Automate in **BDD** using **Gherkin** language
- Obtain at the end of each execution, two types of reports **(ExtentReport, and Cucumber Basic Report)**
- Use the framework's own functions to streamline repetitive tasks
- Execution **sequential** and **parallel**
- Able to include in CD-CI services

This framework is maked based on several technologies that are detailed in the next point. All open source

## Technological Stak

This Framework includes the following technologies:

- [Maven] - Java project management and construction tool (Latest)
- [Java] - OO programming language. (JDK 15.0.2)
- [Rest Assured] - Library for automated test using bdd
- [Cucumber] - Herramienta que nos permite generar scripts de prueba utilizando tests cases escritos en Gherkin **(
  Archivos.feature)**.
- [Gherkin] - Tool that allows us to generate tests scripts using tests cases written in Gherkin **(Files.feature)**.
- [Extent Report] - Intuitive reporter and very nice to look at.
- [JUnit] - Automation tool that will allow us to create Runners and use notations.

**IDE recommended**

- [IntelliJ] - Excellent Ide for automation development (Latest)

**Recommended plugins for IntelliJ**

- **Gherkin**
- **Cucumber for Java**

The technologies mentioned above are integrated into the framework through MAVEN in the **pom.xml** file. The versions
are specified below:

| Technology                      | Maven version | Link Maven repo                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JUnit maven                     | 7.8.1         | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-junit                       |
| Cucumber-java                   | 7.8.1         | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-java                        |
| Cucumber-core                   | 7.8.1         | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-core                        |
| Extent Report Adapter 7         | 1.9.0         | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.aventstack/extentreports                     |
| ExtentReports Cucumber7 Adapter | 1.9.0         | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/tech.grasshopper/extentreports-cucumber7-adapter |
| Rest Assured                    | 5.3.1         | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.rest-assured/rest-assured                     |

**Remember to keep these versions of Maven up to date as much as possible. If the project ever stops working, it could
be because one of the versions found here has been deprecated / moved. However, it must be remembered that at the date
this project was uploaded, all versions are the most current**

## Framework architecture

This Framework uses the automation pattern [Page Object] and is structured as follows.

```
   
â””â”€â”€ src   
    â””â”€â”€ test
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java   
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ com.autoc0de
    |   |       â”œâ”€â”€ runner
    |   |       |   â””â”€â”€ TestRunner.class ----------------> Runner fo the automated tests with JUnit
    â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ steps -------------------------------> Folder where our Pages are stored
    â”‚   â”‚       |   â””â”€â”€ ExampleSteps.class --------------> Example of a step definition  
    |   |       â””â”€â”€ utils
    |   |           â””â”€â”€ Utils.class ---------------------> Class to write some util code, like tokens
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resources           
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ features --------------------------------> Folder where out features files are stored
    â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Example.features --------------------> Example of a feature file
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ extent.properties -----------------------> Report properties
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ extent-config.xml -----------------------> Report config
    â””â”€â”€ pom.xml -----------------------------------------> POM File of this framework    
```

This project is based on 2 levels:

* **Step definitions** (They are all the definitions of our steps written in [Gherkin], in this case, in the
  folder ```steps```)
* **Features** (These are all our .features files written in [Gherkin], in this case, in the folder ```features```)

## Tools needed to run it locally and Steps to run the Framework

In the ```Technological Stack``` section, we will find links that will take us to the websites to download all the tools
we need. However, when using maven, we only need to install:

* Maven 3.9.1 minimal (The latest work fine too)
* Java
* JDK

1. Install Maven 3.9.3
2. Install Java and JDK (Greater 15.0.2)
3. Expose Maven and Java in environment variables (M2_HOME and JAVA_HOME)
4. Inside the root path of the newly cloned project, open the console and execute the following maven
   command: ```mvn install -DskipTests```. This will download all the necessary dependencies found in the ```pom.xml```
   file

Once we have everything we need installed, to run the project we have 2 options:

* Inside the project with an ide (IntelliJ for example), select the file ```TestRunner.class```, right click on it,
  option **"Run"**
* Open console within the path of the newly cloned project and execute the following maven
  command ```mvn clean install tests```

At this time we should be running the test in the console

7. When the execution finishes, we go to the folder ```target / Reports``` where we will find the ExtentReport report
   called``` ExtentReport-HTML.html``` and ```index.html```
8. Finally, if we wish, we execute the maven command ```mvn clean``` to delete the folder ```target``` and all its
   content

## How to change the Suite that is going to be executed

To change the scenario we want to run, we have to modify the ```@Tag``` of [Cucumber] in the file ```TestRunner```
indicated in the following images:

```File TestRunner.class```

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tag.png"/>
</p>

Remember that the ```@tag``` that we are going to replace has to be identical in both files, and it has to exist within
the feature that we want to execute, for example:

```File Feature.feature```

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tag2.png"/>
</p>

## How to see a great Report

If we want to see the report, prior to the execution of the project, we have to go to the ```Target``` folder that is
automatically generated in the project structure.

```
  
â””â”€â”€ src
â””â”€â”€ Target
    â”œâ”€â”€ cucumber-reports -------------------> In this folder we found a basic cucumber report
    â”œâ”€â”€ generated-test-sources
    â””â”€â”€ Reports ----------------------------> in this folder we found 2 type of reports 
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ExtentReport-HTML.html ---------> Greater report of Extent Report
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html ---------------------> Greater report of Extent Report
    â””â”€â”€ test-clases
```

It is as simple as looking for it, opening it with a browser and viewing it


  Examples:


## How to configurate Autoc0de for test yours API's

If you want to use this Framework to automate your own API's (of course), you only have to follow the steps
that I leave you below. Let's go to that

1. Open the ```pom.xml``` file that is in the root of the project, then, look for it property
   called ```<applicationUrl> https://underc0de.org/ </baseURL>``` and replace that address with that of your api

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/url.png"/>
</p>

2. Look for the file called ```TestRunner.class``` (See architecture) and locate the ```@Tag``` located in
   the ```'tags'``` option. Replace ```@ExampleTag``` with the desired tag

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tag.png"/>
</p>

3. Now, add your features files in the folder ```features```and your step definition in the folder ```steps```

4. Done!, now run on a terminal the command: ```mvn clean test``` (Or click on ```TestRunner.class``` ---> ```run```) and
   your project was run!

# Enjoy!
